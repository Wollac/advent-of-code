# Advent of Code Solutions

**[Advent of Code](http://adventofcode.com/about)** is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles created by [Eric Wastl](http://was.tl/). This repository contains some of my solutions for those puzzles.

- To run Python code: `python3 -m aoc.<YEAR>.day<DAY>` **from the repo root**
- *Optional* (if you have Pipenv installed): `pipenv run python3 -m aoc.<YEAR>.day<DAY>`

### Advent of Code data

It is also possible to use the `aoc` console script of [advent-of-code-data](https://pypi.org/project/advent-of-code-data/) to run and compare all the answers:
